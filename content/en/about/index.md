Thank you for visiting! My name is Jason and I'm a molecular biologist, biochemist, and process engineer currently working in the biopharmaceutical industry.  

Outside of my day job as a process development scientist, I spend much of my free time advancing my skills in data analytics, data visualization, and machine learning. As a lifelong student, my eventual goal is to apply these proficiencies to my professional work in biotechnology and beyond.

## Scientific Training

Prior to entering the biotechnology industry, I spent over six years in academia conducting original research in the field of eukaryotic RNA splicing and gene expression regulation while pursuing my doctoral degree. The work published by my colleagues and I continues to bear influence on the RNA research community. I also had the privilege of presenting our discoveries at two international scientific conferences.  

My scientific publications can be viewed on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DM08A88AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Jason+Gabunilas%5BAuthor%5D&sort=date).

I earned my Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2017. I also hold B.S. and M.S. degrees in Biongineering from the University of California, San Diego.

## Programming and Computer Science Training

After completing my doctorate, I began my professional career as a process engineer at a large biotechnology company that specializes in DNA sequencing and genotyping technologies. There, my exposure to massive genotyping datasets nucleated an interest in data science. This inspired me to seek additional training on the subject, leading me to enroll in a [Data Science and Visualization Boot Camp](https://extendedstudies.ucsd.edu/courses-and-programs/data-science-and-visualization-part-i) program at my alma mater, the University of California, San Diego. I completed the program and earned my certificate in 2020.  

I continue to develop and hone my skills in the various facets of data science through independent learning, primarily via MOOC's. Below is a list of relevant courses that I have completed through independent study. I constructed many of the projects featured in my portfolio as assignments during these courses.
